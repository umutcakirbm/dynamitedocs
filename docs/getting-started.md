# 3. How to save a page design to database?

- Mobi-fi saves page designs to database with platform id and auth object id which belongs to selected project.
- Page designs are created as **JSON** data with component properties.
- They also includes style, script settings, controller functions and data sources for using components.
- And client applications which have abilities to render this JSON data render and show them.
